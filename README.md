Hi, I'm River. I've recently converted to data science from teaching, and before that lawyering. I am fluent in English, Java, Python, SQL, and various data science libraries within Pyton. I love using data to figure out something about the world. Also rock climbing. That is cool. You can reach me at https://www.linkedin.com/in/riverbellamy/ or frank.bellamy@gmail.com.
